\description{
This dataset, Thiam_df, is a data frame containing information on thiamethoxam
applications and crop yield measurements in squash plants. The dataset consists
of 165 observations and 11 variables, including treatment types, plant variety,
replication, fruit counts, yield measures, and defoliation indicators. Some
observations may contain missing values.
